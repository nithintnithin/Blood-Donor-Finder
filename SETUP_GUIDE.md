## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Backend Dependencies
Open PowerShell and navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd "c:\Users\NITHIN T\Downloads\Blood-Donor-Finder-Website-main\Blood-Donor-Finder-Website-main\backend"
npm install
```
Wait for installation to complete (this may take 1-2 minutes).

### Step 2: Start the Backend Server
In the same backend folder, run:
```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

**IMPORTANT:** Keep this terminal window open! The server must be running for the website to work.

### Step 3: Access the Website
Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error: "npm: The term 'npm' is not recognized"
**Solution**: You haven't installed Node.js yet. Download and install from https://nodejs.org/, then restart your terminal.

### Error: "Unexpected end of JSON input"
**Solution**: Make sure the backend server is running (terminal shows "Server running on http://localhost:3000")

### Error: "Cannot find module"
**Solution**: Run `npm install` in the backend folder again to install all dependencies.

### Server crashes on startup
**Solution**: The database file may be corrupted. Delete the `backend/data.db` file and restart the server:
```bash
Remove-Item "c:\Users\NITHIN T\Downloads\Blood-Donor-Finder-Website-main\Blood-Donor-Finder-Website-main\backend\data.db"
npm start
```

### Can't log in as admin
**Solution**: If you forgot the password, delete the database file as shown above and create a new admin account.

## 🌐 API Endpoints

The backend provides these REST API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Auth Required | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------------|---------|
| GET | `/api/check-admins` | No | Check if any admins exist |
| POST | `/api/first-admin` | No | Create first admin account |
| POST | `/api/login` | No | Admin login, returns JWT token |
| POST | `/api/admins` | Yes | Create additional admin accounts |
| GET | `/api/donors` | No | Get all donors by institution |
| POST | `/api/donors` | No | Register new donor |
| POST | `/api/institutions` | No | Create new institution |
| DELETE | `/api/institutions/:name` | Yes | Delete institution |
| DELETE | `/api/institutions/:name/donors/:index` | Yes | Delete specific donor |

## 💾 Database Information

The system uses **SQLite** (file-based database):

### Tables
- **admins**: Stores admin credentials (username, hashed password)
- **institutions**: Stores institution/college names
- **donors**: Stores donor information with reference to institutions

### Database File
- Location: `backend/data.db`
- Auto-created on first server start
- You can delete it to reset everything and start fresh

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Passwords**: Hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds) before storage
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens valid for 2 hours
- **All Admin Operations**: Require Bearer token authentication
- **Public Operations**: Anyone can register donors or view lists

---

## ⚡ Performance Tips

- Keep the backend server running in a dedicated terminal
- For production use, consider using environment variables for JWT_SECRET
- The database is stored locally; for multi-user setup, move to PostgreSQL/MySQL

---

## ❓ Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console (F12 in browser) for error messages
2. Check the terminal where server is running for backend errors
3. Verify Node.js is properly installed
4. Try deleting `backend/data.db` and restarting the server

**Congratulations!** Your Blood Donor Finder website is now ready to use! 🎉
