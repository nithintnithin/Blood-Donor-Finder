# ✅ BLOOD DONOR FINDER - COMPLETE & FIXED

## 🎉 What's Been Fixed

Your website had a **JSON parsing error** that's now been completely resolved:

### The Problem
- The `requireAuth` middleware in server.js was incomplete/malformed
- This caused the API to crash when returning responses
- Results in "Unexpected end of JSON input" error

### The Solution
- ✅ Fixed and properly structured the `requireAuth` middleware
- ✅ Verified all API endpoints are correctly implemented
- ✅ Removed duplicate `adminLogin()` function from script.js
- ✅ Confirmed all database operations work correctly
- ✅ Validated all frontend-backend communication
